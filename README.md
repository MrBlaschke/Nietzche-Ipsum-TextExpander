# Nietzche Ipsum for TextExpander

I wanted to have it ever since I discovered [Nietzche Ipsum](http://nietzsche-ipsum.com/) via Product Hunt, but didn't want to spend time converting it to ruby so I can use it in TextExpander. Now that TextExpander 5 supports JavaScript it was a simple copy paste from the site's source with a few modifications:

- Allow user to input number of words using fill-ins
- Change <br /> tags to JavaScript new line.
